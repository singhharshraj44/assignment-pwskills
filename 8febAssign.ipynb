    "Abstraction refers to the ability to focus on essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",

    "#Q.3  What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-- In Python, the abc (abstract base classes) module provides a way to define abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated, and they are used to define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
    "Interfaces, on the other hand, are similar to abstract classes but contain only abstract methods and constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used for defining abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "It provides a base class called ABC (or ABCMeta) that can be subclassed to create abstract classes.\n",
    "Abstract methods are defined using the @abstractmethod decorator, and they are required to be implemented by any concrete class that inherits from the abstract class.\n",
    "The abc module also provides other useful functions and classes for working with abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To enforce a specific interface: By defining an abstract class or interface, we can ensure that any class that implements it provides a specific set of methods and attributes.\n",
    "   This helps to enforce a common API for a group of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To provide a common implementation: Abstract classes can also provide a common implementation for a group of related classes.\n",
    "   This can help to reduce code duplication and improve code maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To improve code clarity and readability: By using abstract classes and interfaces, we can make our code more modular and easier to understand."

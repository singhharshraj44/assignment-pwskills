    " Q1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Ans- Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Which type of programming does Python support?\n",
    "Ans- Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans- Yes Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "Ans- The correct extension of the Python file is “.py”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans- Python is both compiled and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language.\n",
    "Ans- If-Else\n",
    "          For loops\n",
    "          While loops\n",
    "Q7. State a character used to give single line comments in Python.\n",
    "Ans- #\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of Python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans- a) sys.version\n",
    "         b)platform.python_version()\n",
    "        c) platform.python_implementation()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?\n",
    "Ans- Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called 'lambda'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What does pip stand for Python?\n",
    "Ans- PIP stands for Precise Infectious Packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Mention a few built-in functions in Python?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "•\tPython set function.\n",
    "•\tPython sorted function.\n",
    "•\tPython reversed function.\n",
    "•\tPython all function\n",
    "•\tPython range function\n",
    "•\tPython object function\n",
    "•\tPython type function\n",
    "•\tPython character function\n",
    "•\tPython next function\n",
    "•\tPython input function\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "Ans- There is no specific limit on length of an identifier in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "Ans- Python is a very popular high level programming language which is widely used in a variety of domains including data science and machine learning. It is open-source language and free that means code is freely available for anyone to use and modify. Pythons is also cross platform compatible that means we can use python in Mac, Windows, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Ans- Memory is managed in Python by Python interpreter through a mechanism called as reference counting. Every object in Python has a reference count that keeps track of the number of references to that object, when an object’s reference count reaches zero, it is no longer accessible, and its memory is freed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "1.\tAns- Go to the official Python website and download the latest version of Python for Windows. Choose the appropriate version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).\n",
    "2.\tRun the downloaded installer and follow the installation prompts. During the installation process, make sure to select the \"Add Python to PATH\" option.\n",
    "3.\tAfter the installation is complete, open the Windows Command Prompt by pressing the \"Windows key\" + \"R\" and typing \"cmd\" in the Run dialog box.\n",
    "4.\tType the command \"python\" and press \"Enter\". If Python is installed correctly, you should see the Python version number and the Python prompt \">>>\".\n",
    "5.\tTo set the path variables, right-click on the \"This PC\" icon on the desktop and select \"Properties\".\n",
    "6.\tClick on \"Advanced System Settings\" and then click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "7.\tIn the \"System Variables\" section, scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit\".\n",
    "8.\tAdd the path to the Python installation folder at the end of the existing list of paths. For example, if Python is installed in the \"C:\\Python\" folder, add \";C:\\Python\" to the end of the existing path.\n",
    "9.\tClick \"OK\" to save the changes and close all the windows.\n",
    "10.\tOpen a new Command Prompt window and type the command \"python\" again. If Python is correctly installed and the path variables are set up correctly, the Python interpreter should start.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. Is indentation required in Python?\n",
    "Ans- Yes, indentation is required in Python. Unlike many other programming languages that use brackets or other symbols to delimit blocks of code, Python uses indentation to group statements into blocks. The amount of indentation indicates the level of nesting in the code.\n"
